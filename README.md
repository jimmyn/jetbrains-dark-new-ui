# JetBrains Dark New UI

This theme is based on the [JetBrains New Dark](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MoBalic.jetbrains-new-dark) theme.

A theme for Visual Studio Code that closely resembles the new JetBrains Dark theme. The color scheme used in this theme is identical to the one used by JetBrains, ensuring a consistent and familiar look for developers who are accustomed to working with JetBrains IDEs.

**Optional**: For the best experience, consider using the [Jetbrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) font and the [JetBrains Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chadalen.vscode-jetbrains-icon-theme).
